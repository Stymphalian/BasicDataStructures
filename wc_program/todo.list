-- find a better way to output the ordering of option flags
-- find a way for word-occurences to match words other that on word-boundaries
		i.e. words that are not just separated by space,tabs or newlines.
	We more or less want somehting similart to a regexp. The user will input a string
		(i.e. "a string") and the wc utility will parse the file for that pattern of
		the string, but still separated by word boundary.
-- When given an invalid input file, be able to determine the cause
		such as because the file is a directory
		because the file does not exist.
-- Add new options
		--longest-word // prints out the longest word.
-- find a way to handle file names which happend to begin with '-'
-- Modularize the wc such that I can have a single .h and .c file that
	can be used as source for other programs.
